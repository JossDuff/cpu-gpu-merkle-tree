# cpu-gpu-merkle-tree

## TODO:

- [] Test setup for CPU merkle tree (Joss, Nov 4th)
- [] CPU merkle tree implementation (Alexis, Nov 4th)
- [] Benchmark setup for CPU merkle tree (Joss, use Google Benchmark, Nov 4th)
- [] Parallelize CPU merkle tree (Alexis, Nov 4th)

- [] CUDA Tutorial (Joss, Alexis, Nov 7th, meet)

- [] Figure out GPU setup. (Joss, Alexis)
    - [] MAGIC?
    - [] Luigi?
    - [] Chameleon? has better GPU variety and clusters
    - [] Cloud lab? have to make a reservation ahead of time.  Alex uses it every day.  Has RDMA
    - [] Ask Todd for sunlab access for the single GPU (email sent)
- [] Test setup for GPU merkle tree
- [] GPU merkle tree implementation
- [] Benchmark setup for GPU merkle tree
- [] Parallelize GPU merkle tree
    - [] Find best theoretical implementation

- [] Look at DePaul's papers
- [] Test setup for CPU-GPU merkle tree
